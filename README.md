# Jockey's Conference Center

This repository serves as my submission for a lab project assigned during the Human-Computer Interaction course. The objective was to create a prototype for the website of Jockey's Conference Center (JCC).

## Problem Definition
JCC is a famous conference center located in Jakarta, Indonesia. JCC is one of the earliest as well as popular convention centers in Jakarta. First opened in 1974, JCC many important national and international conference, exhibition, fair, indoor sports, and musical concerts were held at JCC including 11th Non-Aligned Movement Conference and Asian-African Conference. It is a very venue place throughout the year.

JCC is currently planning to create a website for their conference center services. So JCC can reach their goal to become an international level conference center in Indonesia. So, the JCC website need to have simple and elegant design. To achieve that, JCC needs to create a website prototype and company website that represents the JCC image. So, JCC entrusts you as a web designer to design their website prototypes and create a company website.
